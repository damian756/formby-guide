These are the places that actually mean dog-friendly: water bowls, space for muddy dogs, staff who don't visibly panic when yours shakes itself at the door. Worth phoning ahead for weekend evenings.",

These are the pubs where dogs are inside, welcome, and don't get the side-eye from the bar. Good food at most of them too: useful after a long walk.",
