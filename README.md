## What This Is

FormbyGuide is an editorial guide to Formby targeting day trippers from Liverpool, Manchester and Wigan, plus families, dog walkers and wildlife spotters. Primary focus: Formby Beach, the National Trust pinewoods, red squirrel reserve, and the village restaurant scene.

No equivalent dedicated Formby guide existed before this — the keyword gap against weak competitors (National Trust, TripAdvisor, formbyevents.co.uk) is wide open.

Part of the [Sefton Coast Network](https://www.churchtownmedia.co.uk/about) — built and operated by Churchtown Media.
